Preserving Tradition, Empowering Communities 

Welcome to Daastan, where we celebrate the artistry of local nomadic artisans and support their livelihoods through sustainable practices. At Daastan, we also believe in the transformative power of creativity and its ability to shape lives!

Discover the Beauty of Traditional Craft 

At Daastan, we believe in the unique beauty and craftsmanship of traditional craft items made by local nomadic artisans. Our online platform showcases a wide range of products created using recycled fabrics and papers, allowing you to admire and own these exquisite pieces of art.

A Global Connection Between Artisans and Customers 

By providing online promotion and sales channels, we connect talented artisans with customers worldwide. Your purchase not only supports their livelihoods but also helps preserve centuries-old techniques and traditions for future generations to appreciate. Daastan provides an intuitive platform that makes it easy for you to support our mission. With a user-friendly interface, you can explore our curated collection, make purchases with ease, and contribute towards empowering the local nomadic artisans. 

Unlocking Creativity for Personal and Social Development 

We firmly believe that creativity is a powerful tool for personal and social development. That's why we collaborate with local nomadic women, known as "jhuggi ladies," to organize craft classes for various groups of children. By participating in these classes, children not only learn valuable skills but also gain confidence in expressing their creativity.

Nurturing Potential through Craft 

Our focus is on school-going children, those with learning disabilities, and children with special needs. Through our carefully designed craft classes, we aim to unlock each child's creative skills, foster their motor skills, and enhance their social interaction abilities.

Bridging Tradition and Innovation 

By introducing children to traditional crafts, we provide them with a connection to their cultural heritage. At the same time, we encourage innovation and self-expression, empowering them to embrace their unique talents and perspectives.

A Safe Space for Growth 

Our craft classes offer a nurturing environment where children can explore their creativity freely. We prioritize inclusivity and strive to create an atmosphere of acceptance and support that encourages personal growth.
